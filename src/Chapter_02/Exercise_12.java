/**
 * (Physics: finding runway length) Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration a and take-off
 speed v, you can compute the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to
 take off using the following formula:
 length = v2/2a
 Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) and the
 acceleration a in meters/second squared (m/s2), and displays the minimum runway
 length.
